# Network Assignments & Projects

<h2>Network Diagram Project Description</h2>

- You have been hired by my company to build and secure my network. The goal of this assignment is for 
you to build out and secure my network as much as possible. Everything in the I.T. world will be focused 
on securing a network in one way or another. By doing this, this will help you better understand the 
concept of defense in-depth and how hard it is to implement security within a budget.
- Those items are as follows: 
  - DMZ: A network that protects and adds an extra layer of security to an organization's internal local-area network from untrusted traffic.
  - Segmentation: A technique that divides a network into smaller. Ex: sub-networks
  - Write out and describe my network in detail and all security features that your team included and why your team
    included those features. 
  - Must keep the network within the one-million-dollar budget I have given you.
  - An asset list with prices on all equipment that will be used.
